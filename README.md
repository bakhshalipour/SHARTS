# SHARTS

This project provides a simulation framework, named **SHARTS**, for evaluating various real-time scheduling algorithms (e.g., [EDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earliest_deadline_first_scheduling)). 

Numerous real-time scheduling algorithms are described in [Buttazzo's book](http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781461406754), and most of them are implemented in this simulator. Meanwhile, the source code can be easily extended to support further algorithms. 

Two implementations are released for the simulator. While both are functionally same, they target different operating systems. One implementation is code in C# and is specific for Windows. No GUI is supported for this version. Another one is coded in Java and targets Android with opulent GUI comfort. 

Please refer to [User's Manual](https://github.com/bakhshalipour/SHARTS/blob/master/SHARTS-UserGuide.pdf) for more information.
