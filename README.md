# SHARTS
An engine for simulating various real-time scheduling algorithms (e.g., EDF, Rate-Monotonic). 

The simulator takes tasks as input and starts to simulate them with a user-specified scheduling algorithm. 
The software is coded for two operating systems: Android and Windows.
The Android app provides rich GUI, but Windows does not. 

Most of the algorithms are obtained from the following book:
Buttazzo, Giorgio C. Hard real-time computing systems: predictable scheduling algorithms and applications. Vol. 24. Springer Science & Business Media, 2011.

I release both codes relevant to Android and Windows. Actually, the project was started with C# and specific for Windows. Then, I converted the code from C# to Java then imported Android libraries.
